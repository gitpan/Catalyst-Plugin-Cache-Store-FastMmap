NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Store::FastMmap - DEPRECATED - FastMmap cache
    store for Catalyst::Plugin::Cache.

SYNOPSIS
        # instead of using this plugin, you can now do this:

        use Catalyst qw/
            Cache
        /;

        __PACKAGE__->config( cache => {
            backend => {
                class => "Cache:FastMmap",
                share_file => "/path/to/file",
                cache_size => "16m",
            },
        });

STATUS
    This plugin is deprecated because Cache::FastMmap no longer needs to be
    wrapped to store plain values. It is still available on the CPAN for
    backwards compatibility and will still work with newer versions of
    Cache::FastMmap with a slight performance degredation.

DESCRIPTION
    This store plugin is a bit of a wrapper for Cache::FastMmap.

    While you could normally just configure with

        backend => {
            class => "Cache::FastMmap",
            share_file => ...,
        }

    Cache::FastMmap can't store plain values by default. This module ships
    with a subclass that will wrap all values in a scalar reference before
    storing.

    This store plugin will try to provide a default "share_file" as well,
    that won't clash with other apps.

CONFIGURATION
    See "CONFIGURATION" in Catalyst::Plugin::Cache for a general overview of
    cache plugin configuration.

    This plugin just takes a hash reference in the backend field and passes
    it on to Cache::FastMmap.

SEE ALSO
    Catalyst::Plugin::Cache, Cache::FastMmap.
